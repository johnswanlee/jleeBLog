This is the first blog post of my life! I will be using this blog to post about anything that I want to share in statistics. For practice, I will run a linear regression with the `iris` dataset.

```{r}
names(iris)
iris_lm <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Petal.Width, data = iris)
summary(iris_lm)
plot(iris_lm, which = 1)
#iris_lm <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ poly(Petal.Length, 2, ra)
```
