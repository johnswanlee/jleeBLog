      <description>My English name is John Lee and my Korean name is Lee SooHwan.
I was born in Gainesville, Florida, and spent most of my childhood in Seoul, South Korea, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I attended Benicia High School in a quiet town called Benicia, which is located in the Bay Area.
I am currently attending University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a double major in Mathematics and Statistics.
This blog is my way of motivating myself to understand statistics more accurately and more in-depth, code, learn and practice statistical models, and ultimately become a better statistician by conveying these ideas in my own way to an imaginary audience.</description>
